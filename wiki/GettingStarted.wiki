= Introduction =

ManiaPress is a suite of plugins and theme to display your WordPress install directly in Maniaplanet.

= Demo =

This URL is the Maniaplanet Blog: http://blog.maniaplanet.com/
Now try to paste that URL in the address bar of the Manialink browser in Maniaplanet.

= Components =

ManiaPress consists of:
  * *ManiaPress Core plugin*: shared config and libraries
  * *ManiaPress Theme Switcher plugin*: automatically selects the ManiaPress Theme when viewing from Maniaplanet, so your install can be both a Manialink and a Website at the same time
  * *ManiaPress Theme*: a theme to display WP as a Manialink
  * *ManiaPress Event Publisher*: automatically post an Event to ManiaHome whenever you publish a post so that everyone that bookmarked your Manialink is kept posted

= Features =

= Requirements =

 * *WordPress 3.0* or higher
 * *PHP 5.3* or or higher
 * (optional) cURL extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)
 * (optional) JSON extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)
 * (optional) You must be able to make HTTPS requests on ws.maniaplanet.com

= Prerequisite: create a Manialink code =

It's better to have your own Manialink code to you can use the Bookmark button and the Event Publisher.

  * Let's say your blog URL is http://www.example.com
  * Login with your Maniaplanet account on http://player.maniaplanet.com
  * Go to *Manialinks*
  * Create a code. The "URL of the XML file" is your blog URL.

For example, the Manialink code *maniaplanetblog* points to http://blog.maniaplanet.com

= Installation =

Unzip the maniapress package directly in your WordPress install. The zip contains the same directory structure as WordPress:

{{{
wp-content/
   plugins/
      maniapress-code/
         ...
      maniapress-theme-switcher.php
      maniapress-event-publisher.php
   themes/
      maniapress/
         ...
}}}

Now you have two choices:

   * *You want your WP install to act only as a Manialink*: enable the *ManiaPress Theme* in the WP Admin panel
   * *You want your WP install to act as both a Manialink and a Website* depending on where it is viewed from: enable the *ManiaPress Theme Switcher* plugin

By now, you should have a basic ManiaPress install working. Let's now see a couple of important configuration options.
