#labels Featured

= Introduction =

ManiaPress is a suite of plugins and theme to display your WordPress install directly in Maniaplanet.

= Demo =

This URL is the Maniaplanet Blog: http://blog.maniaplanet.com/
Now try to paste that URL in the address bar of the Manialink browser in Maniaplanet.

= Components =

ManiaPress consists of:
  * *ManiaPress Core plugin*: shared config and libraries
  * *ManiaPress Theme Switcher plugin*: automatically selects the ManiaPress Theme when viewing from Maniaplanet, so your install can be both a Manialink and a Website at the same time
  * *ManiaPress Theme*: a theme to display WP as a Manialink
  * *ManiaPress Event Publisher*: automatically post an Event to ManiaHome whenever you publish a post so that everyone that bookmarked your Manialink is kept posted

= Features =

todo

= Requirements =

 * *WordPress 3.0* or higher
 * *PHP 5.3* or or higher
 * (optional) cURL extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)
 * (optional) JSON extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)
 * (optional) You must be able to make HTTPS requests on ws.maniaplanet.com

= Prerequisite: create a Manialink code =

It's better to have your own Manialink code to you can use the Bookmark button and the Event Publisher.

  * Let's say your blog URL is http://www.example.com
  * Login with your Maniaplanet account on http://player.maniaplanet.com
  * Go to *Manialinks*
  * Create a code. The "URL of the XML file" is your blog URL.

For example, the Manialink code *maniaplanetblog* points to http://blog.maniaplanet.com

= Installation =

Unzip the maniapress package directly in your WordPress install. The zip contains the same directory structure as WordPress:

{{{
wp-content/
   plugins/
      maniapress-code/
         ...
      maniapress-theme-switcher.php
      maniapress-event-publisher.php
   themes/
      maniapress/
         ...
}}}

Now you have two choices:

   * *You want your WP install to act only as a Manialink*: enable the *ManiaPress Theme* in the WP Admin panel
   * *You want your WP install to act as both a Manialink and a Website* depending on where it is viewed from: enable the *ManiaPress Theme Switcher* plugin

= Basic configuration =

By now, you should have a basic ManiaPress install working. Let's now see a couple of important configuration options.

== Bookmark button ==

The first thing you will want to configure is your Manialink code. *If you set your Manialink code in the config, the ManiaHome bookmark button will automatically appear on your Manialink*.

To do that, you need (for now) to edit wp-content/plugins/maniapress-core/config.php (either manually or with the plugin editor in WP-Admin).

The first option in that file is the manialink code:
{{{
define('MANIAPRESS_CORE_MANIALINK', 'maniaplanetblog');
}}}

Then you can also set the display name so that it appears prettier with special formatting characters ; *use single quotes to avoid PHP errors, and don't forget to put a backslash before any single quote in the display name!*:
{{{
define('MANIAPRESS_CORE_MANIALINK_NAME', '$3cf$oManiaplanet$z Blog');
}}}
