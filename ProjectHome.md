# ManiaPress #

ManiaPress is a suite of plugins and theme to display your WordPress install directly in Maniaplanet.

# Why ManiaPress? #

As the Maniaplanet community is growing, more editorial Websites appear. With ManiaPress, we hope to bring all this great community content directly to the players (and vice-versa).

First, we're giving powerful tools to the editors so they can bring their content directly in Maniaplanet. Then, they'll be able to use the tools to bring the players to their content with ManiaHome bookmarks & events (and later with ManiaPub ads).

# Is it ready? #

It is still an early release with a small set of features, but it works so you should definitely jump in if you're intrested in the project. Don't hesitate to come ask for help or give your feedback on the [dedicated forum](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewforum.php?f=330)!
